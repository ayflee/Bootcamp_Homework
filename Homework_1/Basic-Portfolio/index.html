            <p>Hello! My name is Annie. I was raised in the Seattle area and never thought I'd move back...<br>Well, here I am, living in the Pacific Northwest after working/traveling in Europe, Asia and Africa.
               I got my undergraduate and graduate degrees on the East Coast and in France, but Seattle remains one of my favorite places to live!
               <br>In my spare time, I like to read, hunt down the next best place to eat, and draw/write or do something creative. During the beautiful summer months, I love going to movies in the park or checking out farmers markets. My goals are to get a puppy in the next year and train for a half-marathon! Wish me luck. I'll need a lot of it.
